And just can't find some anywhere?

"Hello Dr. Greenthumb, paging Dr. Greenthumb!"
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
In the hills where the trees grow wild with weed fields
The fucking pigs with shields holding the blue steels
Greenhouse effect with the weed connect
(Doctor) DEA can't keep Greenthumb in check (Doctor!)
HPS, God Bless the whole crop
Please God, don't let me see no cops
Trunkload, ready to hit the highway
Don't let the eye in the sky fly my way
Or we gonna have big trouble, that's no shit
Can't be growing without no permit
But fuck that, I study the 215 trip
That way when they come they can suck my dick
Weed can't grow without attention
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
Ayo Dr. Greenthumb, come on back one time!
People can't live without the herb man
If not they'd be drinking and driving and swerving
But thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow
In the backyard or inside with hydro
To the kush plant brushing a tangerine dream
Tasty, blowing a fucking smokescreen
Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Somebody give me the razor to cut groves
I'd like to stop, but it feels so good
Horny plants stinking up my whole neighborhood
Sticky angel, I want to leave it alone
But never ever ever gotta worry from my home
What that funny sound knocking at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)
Sorry Greenthumb can't talk no more
Please don't follow me into the sun
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (ese!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out
I don't want to buy no weed from no cop
Get knocked up and they close up my shop
That's why I buy no weed from no one
That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb
The scientifical, mystical one
Growing my crops with the rays of the sun
Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb
But you never know what be the outcome
You see the photo in the album
The weed is growing like my erection
Look I never told you where I was from
Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
