They have made a new condition
Rule your life with indecision
Never bite the hand that feeds you
Sit and wait while he deceives you
Oh who gave us this today
Will see tomorrow fade away
They have made a new invention
To smash the roots of our intention
Guide us through these new conditions
Put an end to all ambition
Who gave us this today
Will see tomorrow fade away
