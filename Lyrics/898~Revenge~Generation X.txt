Suzie came to London,
To have her fortune told.
Now she is a mother she's feeling kinda old,
When she gets the money.
She'll take a knife for two.
She'll slit her throat of the one she trusts,
Of the one who stole the right to choose.

Revenge,
Revenge,
Revenge,
Revenge. 

Johnny came out looking,
Looking for his friends,
Back at home there was no chance.
He took what she could get.
See Johnny had a vision,
That men would no his name,
But they sucked him in and spat him out,
You know there all the same.

Revenge,
Revenge,
Revenge,
Revenge,
That's what they want.
So as I get older.
I looked deep in their eyes.
Now I've learned to tell,
When I'm wasting time.
'Cause they won't give you nothing,
They like to see you fall.
Well 1 day I'm gonna walk through the door,
I'm gonna take it on.

That's revenge,
Revenge,
Revenge,
Revenge,
Revenge,
That's what they want.
Revenge,
Revenge.
