Lean out your window
Golden hair
I heard you singing
In the midnight air

My book is closed
I read no more
Watching the fire dance
On the floor

I've left my book
I've left my room
I heard you singing
Through the gloom

Singing and singing
A merry air
Lean out of the window
Golden Hair
