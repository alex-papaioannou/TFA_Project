Some think the world is made for fun and frolic,
And so do I!
Some think it well to be all melancholic,
To pine and sigh;
But I, I love to spend my time in singing
Some joyous song;
To set the air with music bravely ringing
Is far from wrong!
Listen! Listen! echoes sound afar!
Listen! Listen! echoes sound afar!
Funiculi funicula`, funiculi funicula`,
Echoes sound afar! funiculi, funicula`.

Some think it wrong to set the feet a-dancing,
But not so I;
Some think that eyes should keep from coyly glancing
Upon the sly!
But oh! to me the mazy dance is charming,
Divinely sweet,
And surely there is nought that is alarming
In nimble feet?
Listen! Listen! music sounds afar!
Listen! Listen! music sounds afar!
Funiculi funicula`, funiculi funicula`,
Music sounds afar! funiculi, funicula`.

Ah me! 'tis strange that some should take to sighing,
And like it well;
For me, I have not thought it worth the trying,
So cannot tell!
With laugh and dance and song the day soon passes,
Full soon is gone,
For mirth was made for joyous lads and lasses
To call their own!
Listen! Listen! hark! the soft guitar!
Listen! Listen! hark! the soft guitar!
Funiculi funicula`, funiculi funicula`,
Hark! the soft guitar! funiculi funicula`.
