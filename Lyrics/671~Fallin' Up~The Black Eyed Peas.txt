Watch me(fallin' up)
Watch me(fallin' up)
Watch me(fallin' up high)
Watch me

Focus on this the introductionist,
Or a lyricist in this rap metropolis,
More like an activist,
We give it to you all,
Presentation we'll make you have a ball, 
Styles start considering causing you to meditate,
Manipulate the mind with hypnotical legislate,
We far from the fakes,
We never fake moves,
But jealous motherfuckers since the justice approves,(and talk shit)
And who the hell he be havin' a fit,
Yo, he ain't got shit,
That's why he said Crips,
And I identify what he rips,
Skiznits of nonsense nothing less than bullshit,(West Side)
And who can hang with the all around remainders,
A real entertainer,
We 'bout to open up the whole true hip hop,
Explore non-stop,
Entertain ya till you drop,

[Chorus: Repeat x2]
We be fallin' up(up)
Never fallin' down(down)
We keep it at a higher level elevating now,
(Put it in your)in your area,
(City or your)town,
Black Eyed Peas is known for gettin' down

Pick the core steps you take is it fake
There's no remorse for a fake we must break,
Time of rap source of dough that we make(a)
You'll collapse feel the forceful intake,
Witness the Peas as we innovate,
We'll extrodanite, expose, instillate,
Patterning pioneers    
Apple intact is the time we must take,
When we make agreements there's no escape,
Form it, hate it, love it, rate it as great,
God gave us talent,
We show how that we create,
Enough of being deep it's time to motivate,

[Chorus]

Watch me,
Watch me,

I see you try to diss our function by stating that we can't rap,
Is it 'cause we don't wear Tommy Hilfiger or baseball caps,
We don't use dollars to represent,
We just use our inner sense and talent,
If you try to dis the Peas you'll get handled by Apple Beavy,
Alligator, numero uno creator,
Black Eyed Peas be more than a playa,
Don't gotta represent no set just so I could get some respect,
Ga ga ga ga ga ga cooooool,
A lot of feelings so I can get through,
Because the way that you did it I think that you done corrupted the whole
Hip-hop sound so now I gotta follow up,

[Chorus]
