There is no other to compare with you
You've got me, darlin', givin' all that I have to you
You showed me feelings that I, I'll never find
But those feelings ain't complete
When you're not here all the time

Oh baby love, oh baby love
Early in the mornin', early in the mornin'
You come creepin' in my mind, oh baby love, oh baby love
Oh baby love, oh baby love
I wake up with a yearnin', oh I'm yearnin'
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love

Give me reasons to be a fool for you
But I don't care about foolish pride when it's concerned in you
I'll be astray, yes I will, give me your command
You can call on me to stay around you all I can

Oh baby love, oh baby love
Early in the mornin', early in the mornin'
You come creepin' in my mind, oh baby love, oh baby love
Oh baby love, oh baby love
I wake up with a yearnin', oo wo wo
Burnin' for your touch, I'm burnin'
Burnin' for your touch, I'm burnin'
Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love

Oh, all I do is think about you, baby love
All I do is think about you, baby love
I want your love, I need your love
I want your love, come on, oh

You've got me darling, darling, darling, giving all I have to you
Feelings, feelings I'll never find
But those feelings ain't complete when you're not here all the time

Oh baby love, baby love
Early in the mornin', early in the mornin'
You come creepin' in my mind, oh baby love, oh baby love
Oh baby love, oh baby love
