Here I am, head over heel in love again 
Here I am, head over heel in love again 

Besides you, woman it was my mother and that's where love begins 
I used to be a playboy, I played hard both night and day 
I used to be a playboy and I played hard both night and day 
But since I met Miss Lemon, she has made me change my ways 

Oh yes woman, you've caught the old coon at last 
Oh yes woman, you have caught the old coon at last 
But I just hope I be happy with my future, as I am with my present and past 
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes 

They caught the old coon at last 
Now I love the life I'm livin', and I'm livin' the life I love 
Now I love the life I'm livin', and I'm livin' the life I love 
Woman I don't believe I could be any happier, if I was livin' in heaven above
