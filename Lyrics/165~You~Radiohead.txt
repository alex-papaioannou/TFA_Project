You are the sun the moon and stars
Are you and I could never run away from you

You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you

It's like the world is gonna end so soon
And why should I believe myself?

Yeah

You, me, and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see you drowning
Caught in the fire 

You, me, and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see you drowning
Caught in the fire
