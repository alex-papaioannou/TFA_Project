Do you know how it hurts when a fairytale burns?
Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day

She said she'd never love again
Because he broke her heart
And now she's blaming him
But he told her from the start
That what they had was special
But it ain't really love
Although he gave her everything
She never had his heart
But that's all that she needs
So what's tearing her apart?
'Cause loving him is hard
But that's all she really wants
She treats him like a king
And he treats her like a queen
But when he don't come home
He don't tell her where he's been
But she already knows
He got lipstick in his clothes
It's the message in his phone
And the smell of his cologne
But she don't say a tone or even moan
She don't stress, fight or fuss
She just keeps it to her own

When she cries, she dries her eyes
She never lied in her life
So his lies sound like knives every night
In the morning she's all right
'Cause she don't wanna fight
But tonight she'll be gone forever

When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day

He said he'd never love again
'Cause he don't want the pain
Of having someone special
Do that shit to him again
And though it ain't his fault
There ain't no-one else to blame
For all those sunny days
When all you see is rain
All you got are memories
But that just ain't the same

'Cause the woman that he loved
Must have simply gone away
And everyday he wakes up
Feeling like he's up in chains
And now her sweetest touch
Is like a shot to his brain
And this is just a shame
'Cause she don't say a thing
Except to break his heart
Like she's in a wicked game
That he ain't trying to play
But he's stuck trying to win
'Cause he's stuck loving someone
Who just ain't in love with him

But he's in love with her
And this is where it hurts
No but she don't give a damn
Or even know his worth
She treats him like he's dirt
That she can throw away
But he ain't going away
'Cause today's gonna be the day

Do you know how it hurts when a fairytale burns?
Love is a refugee
Ain't that absurd?
You know how it feels
When sudden dreams slowly fade to grey
This is my independence day

So forgive me but I'm gone now
'Cause I'm free and I'm never coming home now
I'll find hope in forever
'Cause I'm thrown now
And I'm flying and I ain't gonna go down
I used to think we were magic but slow down
You didn't know what you had when you had it
And now you realise that it's gone like magic
And I guess you really want me back, right?
Well, forget it
