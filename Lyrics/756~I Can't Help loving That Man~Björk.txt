Fish got to swim, birds got to fly 
I got to love one man 'til I die 
can't help loving that man of mine 

Maybe he's lazy, maybe he's slow 
maybe I'm crazy, maybe I know 
can't help loving that man of mine 

And when he's away
that's a rainy day 
but when he's back 
the day is fine - the sun will shine 

He can stay out as long as can be 
home without him ain't no home for me 
can't help loving that man of mine
