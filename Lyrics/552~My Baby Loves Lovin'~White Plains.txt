My baby loves love
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes
And she know how to use it

My baby loves love
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes
And she know how to use it

I was lonely once in this great big world

Just a nowhere man without his girl
When she came my way

She smiled at me as if to say

My baby loves love
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes
And she know how to use it

My baby loves love
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes
And she know how to use it

She's the only one makes me feel so good
Believing in my lovin' so I'm all gone good
All my sorrows and fears seem to fly away
She looks at me as if to say

My baby loves love
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes
And she know how to use it 
For me

No more lonely nights waiting for the phone to ring
No more lonely days my baby's taken care of everything
I'm telling you people

My baby loves love
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes
And she know how to use it

My baby loves love
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes
And she know how to use it

She's the only one makes me feel so good
Believing in my lovin'
All my sorrows and fears seem to fly away
She looks at me as if to say

My baby loves love
My baby loves lovin'
She's got what it takes
And she know how to use it...
