You came to me from out of nowhere, you took my heart and found it free,
Wonderful dreams, wonderful schemes from nowhere,
Make every hour as sweet as a flower to me.
If you should go back to your nowhere. leaving me with just a memory,
I'll always wait for your return out of nowhere,
Hoping you bring your love to me
