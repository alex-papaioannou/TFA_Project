They say you've found somebody new,
But that won't stop my loving you.
I just can't let you walk away,
Forget the love I had for you.
Guess I could find somebody, too,
But I don't want no one but you.
How could you leave without regret?
Am I that easy to forget?
Before you leave be sure you find
You want her (his) love much more than mine.
'Cause I'll just say we've never met,
If I'm that easy to forget.
