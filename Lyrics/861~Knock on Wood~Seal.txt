I don't want to lose you
This good thing
That I've got 'cause if I do
I will surely, surely lose a lot

Cause her love is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder and lightning
The way your love is frightening
I better knock on wood, baby

I'm not superstitious about you
But I can't take no chance
You got me spinning, baby
Baby I'm in a trance

Cause your love is better
Than any love I know
It's like thunder and lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood, baby

It's no secret that woman
Fills my loving cup
'Cause she sees to it
That I get enough

Just one touch from her
You know it means so much
It's like thunder and lightning
The way your love is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby, I better knock

Think I better knock on wood [Repeat: x3]
Think I better knock, knock, knock
Think I better knock, knock, knock
