Wishing I was dreaming,
Wishing I didn't know.
All the thoughts I was thinking,
I don't want to know.

Everyone's always moving,
I'm standing still for all the time.
Thoughts that I was living,
Echoes in my mind.

There's so much more that I could be,
So many places that I'll never see.
So many lives that I'll never meet.
I'll just dream until we get there in the end.

Always thinking 'bout tomorrow,
Before today is even through.
Always thinking 'bout the future,
What on earth will happen to you?

There's so much more that I could be,
So many places that I'll never see.
So many lives that I'll never meet.
I'll just dream until we get there in the end.

And if the world stops spinning,
Would I start moving home?
And if the world stopped dreaming,
Would I stop believing in it all?

There's so much more that I could be,
So many places that I'll never see.
So many lives that I'll never meet.
I'll just dream until we get there in the end.
I'll just dream until we get there in the end.
I'll just dream until we get there in the end.
