Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head
Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head
Tried to tell the woman
But she won't believe a thing I said

Go light pretty baby
Gonna need my help some day
Go light pretty baby
Gonna need my help some day
You're gonna wish you listened
To some of those things I said

Say go ahead pretty baby
Go on and knock yourself out
I said go ahead pretty baby
Go on and knock yourself out

I still love you baby
But you don't know what it's all about

Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head
Bright lights, big city
Gone to my baby's head

Tried and tried to tell my woman
But she doesn't believe a word I said
