Ho, oh, oh, oh

This is just a melody
That's comin' straight from the heart
Don't know why but I, I have a need to tell you
It's been heavy on my heart to tell my friends

We don't know when, we don't know where
We don't know how but oh, we know
He is comin' just like a thief
In the night

Oh, yeah, um, in the twinklin' of an eye

We don't know when, we don't know where
We don't know how but oh, we know
He is comin' like a thief
In the night

He is comin', He is comin'
He is comin', He is comin'
He is comin', He is comin'

He is comin', He is comin'
He is comin', He is comin'
He is comin', He is comin'

Jesus is
Jesus is
Jesus is comin'

Jesus is
Jesus is
Jesus is comin'
