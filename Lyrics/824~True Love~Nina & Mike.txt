I give to you and you give to me
True love true love
So on and on it will always be
True love true love
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothing to do

But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever true
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothing nothing to do
But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever true
