I know this silence, been here before.
I'm walking blinded through your door.
This is a sense of things to come,
This innocence... oh, oh.

Breathe in this moment, it's come and gone
Further and faster through your soul.
Open your eyes and breathe some more,
Open your mouth... oh, oh.

Release yourself, it's a big sky.
Reveal yourself, it's a big sky.
We love, we leave. We take, we give.
Release yourself, it's a big sky.

It's a big sky...
It's a big sky...
