The gal dem Schillaci, Sean da Paul
So me give it to, so me give to, so me give it to, to all girls
Five million and forty naughty shorty, 
Baby girl, all my girls, all my girls Sean da Paul sey, 

[Chorus]
Well woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature to shelter you from the storm
Oh lord, gal I got the right tactics to turn you on, and girl I, 
Wanna be the Papa, You can be the Mom, oh oh!

Make I see the gal them bruk out pon the floor 
From you don't want no worthless performer
From you don't want no man wey 
Can't turn you on gal make I see your hand them up on ya
Can't tan pon it long, naw eat no yam, no steam fish, nor no green banana
But down in Jamaica we give it to you hot like a sauna

[Chorus]

Bumper exposed and gal you got your chest out 
But you no wasters cause gal you impress out, 
And if you des out a me you fi test out,
Cause I got the remedy to make you de-stress out
Me haffi flaunt it because me God Bless out, 
And girl if you want it you haffi confess out,

With a bredda like me girl there is no other
No need to talk it right here just park it right here keep it undercover
From me love how you fit inna you blouse 
And you fat inna you jeans and mi waan discover
Everything out you baby girl can you hear when me utter,
