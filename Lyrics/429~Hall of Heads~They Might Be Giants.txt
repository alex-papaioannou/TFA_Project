Here in the hall of heads
You look through the keyhole
This is the hall of heads
One step through the doorway

Roll out that special head
This is our favorite one
Please don't try to leave
Don't leave the hall of heads

Hide underneath the porch
Hide down behind the furnace
You can't get away
You can't really hide
Once you hear the call
The song of the hall of heads

You can't run away
Your feet won't help you run
You can't run away
Out of the hall of heads
