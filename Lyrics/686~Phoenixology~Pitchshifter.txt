You say you've got to get away,
But where are you going to go?

Raise down, (dis)town.

You've got to go, got to get away,
There's something you should know,
(It's all the same).

No solutions, just consolations.
Universal town (transposable location).

This town (this could be anywhere).
This town (this could be everywhere).

You're desperation's got it's place, you'll never beat this town.
You'd love to shove it in their face, they'd love to drag you down.

No solutions, just consolations.
Universal town (transposable location).

This town (this could be anywhere).
This town (this could be everywhere).

Still say you've got to get away? There's nowhere you can go.
It's all the same, it's all the same old show.

This town (this could be anywhere).
This town (this could be everywhere)...
