Well, I get rattled every time we meet
I get rattled even in my sleep
I get rattled, baby, over you

I get twisted, I get turned around
I get twisted, and I'm up then I'm down
I get twisted, baby, over you

Well, baby, baby, baby won't you save one night for me
Baby, baby, baby is there something wrong with you
Baby, baby, baby this is out of my control
It may look like nothing's wrong but deep down in my soul
I'm twisted - shaken - rattled
I get rattled, baby, over you

Rattled baby, over you
Oh, baby, baby, baby won't you save one night for me
Baby, baby, baby is there something wrong with you
Oh, baby, baby this is out of my control
It look like nothing's wrong but deep down in my soul
I'm rattled - twisted - shaken
I get twisted, baby, over you

Oh,I get shaken, I'm torn up by the roots
Yeah, I'm shakin', way down in my boots
I get rattled, baby, over you
I get rattled, baby, over you

Yeah IÂ´m rattled, baby, over you
