Very superstitious, writings on the wall 
Very superstitious, them ladders 'bout to fall, yeah 
Thirteen-month-old baby, yeah, broke the lookin' glass 
Seven years of bad luck, oh, them good things in your past

Oh, but when you believe in things
That you don't understand 
And then you suffer 
Don't you know that superstition ain't the way? 

No, oh, oh, ohh
Oh, no, no, no no

Very superstitious, wash your face and hands 
Rid me of my problem, do all that you can, oh 
Keep me in a daydream, yeah, keep me goin' strong
You keep me, keep me goin' strong 
You don't wanna save me, sad is my song 

No, but when you believe in things
That you don't understand 
And then you suffer 
Don't you know that superstition ain't the way?

Oh, no, no, no no
No, no
Oh, no, no, no no

No, no, no, no no

Very superstitious, there's nothin' more to say 
Very superstitious, the devil is on his way, yeah, oh 
Thirteen-month-old baby, yeah, broke the lookin' glass, oh 
Seven years of bad luck, oh, them good things in your past 

Oh, but when you believe in things
That you don't understand 
And then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way, oh
