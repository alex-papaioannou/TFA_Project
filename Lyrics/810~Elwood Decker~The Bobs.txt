Elwood Decker died the other day
He was abstractly struck by a train
He lived in Nipomo but he painted his own way
He was tragically killed in the rain
For 88 years he walked on the track
For 88 years he never looked back
Now he's gone, that's the end of Moy Mell
He's gone and there's no more to tell
