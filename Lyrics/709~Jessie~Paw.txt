Pet the dog, pet the dog, pet the dog
And, scratch my ear, scratch my ear, scratch my ear
Please play with me, play with me, play with me

Aw, but Jessie
It's cold outside
And I'm not comin' home
I don't know where I'll be
Oh, when the mornin' comes
And Jessie you're a good dog
Please don't follow me 
Just go on home

I ran away
Dog tagged along
I lost the dog 
Dog tagged along
I lost the dog 
It broke my heart
Please stay with me, and play with me, stay with me

Aw, but Jessie
It's cold outside
And I'm not coming home
I don't know where I'll be
Oh, when the mornin' comes
And Jessie, you're a good dog
Please don't follow me 
Just go on home 
Just go on home
Jessie, don't follow me
Jessie, go on home

Aw, Jessie, you're a good dog, such a good dog
Yeah and Jessie, you're a good dog, such a good dog
Hey, Jessie, you're a good dog, such a good dog 
Aw, Jessie, you're a good dog, such a good dog
Mmm, Jessie, you're a good dog, such a good dog
Jessie, you're a good dog, such a good dog 

Go on home, boy
