Aggressively, we all defend the role we play
Regrettably, the time's come to send you on your way
We've seen it all: from bonfires of trust to flash floods of pain
It doesn't really matter; don't you worry, it will all work out
No, it doesn't really matter; don't worry, that ain't what it's all about

We hope you enjoyed your stay
And it's good to have you with us
Even if it's just for the day
We hope you've enjoyed your stay
Outside the sun is shining
It seems like heaven ain't far away
It's good to have you with us
Even if it's just for the day
