Cousins, kissin' cousins

Kissin's allowed 'cause we're proud to be cousins

What's a little teasin', huggin' and a-squeezin'

Between us cousins.

Oh it's so great to be one big family

And we show it, yes we show it

You see, we never feud, we're a happy brood

Folks all know it, yes they know it

Cousins, kissin' cousins

Honey we dress and we mess

We're just cousins,

Cousins, kissin' cousins

Cousins, kissin' cousins
