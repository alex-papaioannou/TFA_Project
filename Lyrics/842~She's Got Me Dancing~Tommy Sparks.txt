Hey, what'd you know about the song and the dance and the wine?
That boy is looking at you and he says that he knows your kind
I see you dancin' but you never ever mark your words
Hey, what do you know, I think you've gotta do this up again

Have you ever
Felt so lonely
In this cold
World, so cold
Have you ever
Felt so lonely

She's got me dancin'
She's got me dancin'
She's got me dancin
And she's always one step behind (x2)

Hey, you, I move to the side
Just to lift a little least of your life
That ex got a bullet in the side and she likes what you did before
You see me dancin' but I never ever like to talk
Hey, what do we know, I think we've done it to ourselves again

Have you ever
Felt so lonely
In this cold
World, so cold
Have you ever
Felt so lonely

She's got me dancin'
She's got me dancin'
She's got me dancin
And she's always one step behind (x2)

Have you ever
Felt so lonely
In this cold
World, so cold
Have you ever
Felt so lonely

She's got me dancin'
She's got me dancin'
She's got me dancin
And she's always one step behind (x4)
