Alison, I've been giving you quite some time
And given time, don't you think that I deserve some?

Please give in
Cause I've been waiting
Please give in 
'Cause I've been wasting away

Now I feel I'm stuck in between
It's a shame that you won't come
Close to me

Alison, sometimes I think you'd rather let me go
And given that, don't you think I ought to know

Please give in
'Cause I've been waiting
Please give in 
'Cause I've been wasting away

Now I feel I'm stuck in between
It's a shame that you won't come
Close to me
A substitute for love, desperate needs
Maybe this is all
This is me

Baby, I'm not sure if this is love

Lovers keep their secrets
Baby, I'm not sure if this is love
And love can make us greedy
Baby I don't think that's for us
It's not for me to be

Lovers keep their distance
Maybe they don't like what they see
And love can make us jealous 
Baby there's no right for me to be
It's not for me to see

If we give in 
Maybe we'll be like them
I don't want the sadness
To be ours too
Baby there's no pressure 
On you

Lovers keep their secrets
Baby, I'm not sure if this is love
And love can make us greedy
Baby I don't think that's for us
It's not for me to be

If we give in 
Maybe we'll be like them
I don't want the sadness
To be ours too
Baby there's no pressure 
On you

Lovers keep their secrets
Baby, I'm not sure if this is love
