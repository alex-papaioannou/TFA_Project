Annie had a baby, can't work no more
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Annie had a baby, can't work no more
Every time she start to working
She has to stop to walk the baby 'cross the floor

She had to walk with the baby
Instead of me
Talk to the baby
Instead of me
Sing to the baby
Instead of me
Cling to the baby
Instead of me
Now I know I know Annie understood
That's what's happens when the game gets good
