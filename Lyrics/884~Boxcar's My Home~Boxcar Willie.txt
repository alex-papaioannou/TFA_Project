Boxcar's my home, railroad my friend
It's been that way since I don't know when
I'm here today, tomorrow I'm gone
Where I hang my hat is where I call home

Stars at night my roof over head
The ground below where I make my bed
Horizons you see well that is my walls
When the sun comes up my hobo blood calls

Stars at night my roof over head
The ground below where I make my bed
Horizons you see well that is my walls
When the sun comes up my hobo blood calls

Boxcar's my home, railroad my friend
It's been that way since I don't know when
I'm here today tomorrow I'm gone
Where I hang my hat is where I call home
