Now when I get the blues, I get me a rockin' chair
When I get the blues, I get me a rockin' chair
Well, if the blues overtake me gonna rock right away from here

Now when I get lonesome, I jump on the telephone
When I get lonesome, I jump on the telephone
I call my baby, tell her I'm on my way back home

Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye

Give me one more kiss, hold it a long long time
Give me one more kiss, hold it a long long time
Now love me baby, till the feelin' hits my head like wine

Here comes my baby, flashin' her new gold tooth
Here comes my baby, flashin' her new gold tooth
Well she's so small, she can mambo in a pay phone booth

Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Ah, don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye

I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog, sittin' on a hollow stump
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog, sittin' on a hollow stump
I got so many women, I don't know which way to jump

Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Now flip, flop and fly
I don't care if I die
Now, don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye
Oh my!
