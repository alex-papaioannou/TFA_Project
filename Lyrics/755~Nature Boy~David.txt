This story is about love
The woman I loved is dead

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy

They say he wandered very far
Very far over land and sea

A little child and sailed about
But very wise, was he

And then one day, one magic day he passed my way 
While we spoke of many things fools and kings, this he said to me

The greatest thing, you'll ever learn
Is just to love, and be loved in return
