One, two
One, two, three, four

Carry me back to old Virginia
That's where the cotton
And the corn and taters grow
Keep on growing now

That's where the birds
Love to sing in the springtime
That's where I’m going
Virginia is my home, sweet home

I’m coming home
(I’m coming home)
I’m coming on home
(I’m coming home)
I got a city boy's cotton field back home

You better beat it now
Carry me back to old Virginia
That's where I’m coming
Virginia is my home, sweet home

I’ma coming home
(I’m coming home)
Lord, am coming on back home now
(I’m coming home)
I got a city boy's cotton field, back home

Yeah you better beat it now
Carry me back, to old Virginia
That's where I’m coming
Virginia is my home sweet home

I'm coming home
(I’m coming home)
Lord, am coming home now
(I’m coming home)

Yeah you better believe me
(I’m coming home)
I'm bringing it all in
(I’m coming home)

I gotta get back home
(I’m coming home)
I'm all always home
(I’m coming home)

I gotta get back in now
(I’m coming home)
I gotta get back in now here
(I’m coming home)
