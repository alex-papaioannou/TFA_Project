My father used to tell me, don't live your life alone
You'll want someone to be there late at night when you get home
We were sitting in a cafe, I could have cried right then & there 
Face to face with loneliness that father & daughter shared

Chorus:
Is it too late for me,
I've spent a lifetime searching
Somebody please find me
I need someone who like me
Is also searching

Well I came close so often I thought that he might be the one
He only wanted company while he shined in the sun
And now I toss and turn at night, afraid I'll never find
The one who is my other half, the one meant to be mine

Chorus

Some men seek for riches
Others search for fame
Everybody looks for love
That will never change
