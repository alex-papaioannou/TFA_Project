[Chorus:]
Lay awake at night,
Oh so low, just so troubled.
Can't get a job,
Laid off and I'm having double trouble.

Hey hey, to make you've got to try.
Baby, that's no lie.
Some of this generation is millionaires,
I can't even keep decent clothes to wear.

Laugh at me walking,
And I have no place to go.
Bad luck and trouble has taken me
I have no money to show.

[Chorus]
