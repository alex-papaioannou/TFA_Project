Time it took the most of me
And left me with no key
To unlock the chest of remedy
Mother, the pain ain't hurting me
But the love that I feel
When you hold me near

The hopes were high
The choirs were vast
Now my dreams are left to live through you

Red Sun rising
Drown without inhaling
Within, the dark holds hard
Red Sun rising
Curtain falling
Higher than hope my cure lies

Passion tide
An angel by my side

But no Christ to end this war
To deliver my soul from the sword
Hope has show me a scenery
Paradise poetry
With first snow I'll be gone

The hopes were high

Red Sun rising

Your death saved me

Red Sun rising
