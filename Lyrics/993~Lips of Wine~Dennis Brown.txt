Well, I've been thinking lately much of my baby
Thinking how she needs me, yeah
And I don't see you know if she's feeling so bad
Feeling so bad, feeling so bad

Maybe it?s better
If I forget her
Let her go on

How I long to hold her tenderly
How I long to hold her close to me
Maybe someday she will change her mind
And let me taste her lips of wine

Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the evening

Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine

Maybe it?s better if
I forget her
Let her go on

How I long to her hold her tenderly
How I long to hold her close to me
Maybe someday she will change her mind
And let me taste her lips of wine

Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the evening

Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine
