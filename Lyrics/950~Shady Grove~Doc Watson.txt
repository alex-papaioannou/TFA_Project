(chorus)

Shady Grove, my little love
Shady Grove I say
Shady Grove, my little love
I'm bound to go away

Cheeks as red a a blooming rose
And eyes are the prettiest brown
She's the darling of my heart
Sweetest girl in towm

(chorus)
(break)

I wish I had a big fine horse
And corn to feed him on
And Shady Grove to stay at home
And feed him while I'm gone

(chorus)
(break)

Went to see my Shady Grove
She was standing in the door
Her shoes and stockin's in her hand
And her little bare feet on the floor

(chorus)
(break)

When I was a little boy
I wanted a Barlow knife
And now I want little Shady Grove
To say she'll be my wife

(chorus)
(break)

A kiss form pretty little Shady Grove
Is sweet as brandy wine
And ther ain't no girl in this old world
That's's prettier than mine

(chorus)
