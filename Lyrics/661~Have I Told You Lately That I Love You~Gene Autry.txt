Have I told you lately that I love you
Could I tell you once again somhow
Have I said with all my heart and soul how I adore you
Well darling, I'm telling you now.

My world would end without a mem'ry of you
I'm no good without you anyhow
Oh, have I told you lately that I love you
My darling, I'm telling you now.

Have I told you lately how I miss you
When the stars are shining in the sky
Have I told you why the nights are long when you're not with me
Well darling, I'm telling you now.

Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
Every dream, I dream is you somehow
Have I told you that I'd like to share your love forever
Well, darling, I'm telling you now.

My world would end without a mem'ry of you
I'm no good without you anyhow
Oh, have I told you lately that I love you
Oh! darling, I'm telling you now.
