So close the warmth between us grows
The seeds are budding healthy
The color of wanting more
Your body now
What you are doing won't be forgotten
And without warning your wish comes true

Watching you
Watching you
Watching you
Watching me

I won't faint, I won't break
Stop your doubting now
And be your own true love
You're breaking down from your take on me
I lose all once you know
That other body won't see the morning
I'll leave you lonely, I'll leave you more

Watching
Waiting
Wanting
Needing
