Words are floating through the windows
And in the house she blows them away
Faded in the morning time

Haters with their hearts asunder 
Will ruin our parade
Faded in the morning time

Walking through the winter markets 
And all the horses floated away
Faded in the morning time

Sun is rising
Stings my eyes and don't wanna die today
Faded in the morning time

Words are floating through the windows
And in the house she blows them away
Faded in the morning time

Haters with their hearts asunder 
Will ruin our parade
Faded in the morning time

Walking through the winter markets 
And all the horses floated away
Faded in the morning time

Sun is rising
Stings my eyes and don't wanna die today
Faded in the morning time
