So I send an SOS
Semaphore myself
Catch me falling finally
Through the air and underground
Everywhere this sound
Screams whisper "I can't breathe"
I feel it in my bones
Though I know I'm not alone
You're spinning far too far from me
So cruel to be so kind
Now I know I'll always find
This island earth
A mystery

As I stumble through the dark
Dream lovers dream apart
Starry eyed a vision rushes in
Do I wonder or care
My spirit's bleeding god knows where
A never ending stream

I tried to love, tried to find
My soul in shadows running blind
And restless as the sea
Via sidewalks through the haze
Wandering as in a maze
Lost in number time and space
So near and yet so far
Castaway as strangers are
This island earth
And you and me
