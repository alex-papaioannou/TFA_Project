Aw, uh baby
Spy on me, baby use satellite
Infrared to see me move through the night
Aim, gonna fire, shoot me right
Aim, gonna like the way you fight

Now you found the secret code
I used to wash away my lonely blues well
So I can't deny or lie cause you're the only one to make me fly
Sexbomb sexbomb you're a sexbomb 
You can give it to me when I need to come along give it to me
Sexbomb sexbomb you're my sexbomb
And baby you can turn me on

Sexbomb sexbomb you're my sexbomb
You can give it to me when I need to come along
Sexbomb sexbomb you're my sexbomb
And baby you can turn me on 
Baby you can turn me on
Baby you can turn me on
