I know a millionaire 
Who's burdened down with care
A load Is on his mind
He's thinking of the day 
When he must pass away
And leave his world behind 

I haven't any gold 
To leave when I grow old
Somehow its passed by
I'm very poor but still 
I leave a precious will
When i must say goodbye

I leave the sunshine to the flowers
I leave the spring time to the trees
And to the old folk I leave a memory 
Of a baby upon their knees 
I leave the nighttime to the dreamers
I leave the songbird to the blind 
I leave the moon above to those in love 
when I leave the world behind, when I leave the world behind 

I leave the sunshine to the flowers
I leave the springtime to the trees
And to the old folk I leave a memory 
Of a baby upon their knees
I leave the nighttime to the dreamers
I leave the songbird to the blind
I leave the moon above to those in love 
When I leave the world behind
When I leave the world behind
