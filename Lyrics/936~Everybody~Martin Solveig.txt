Everybody run, everybody knows,
Everybody pull the gun, everybody rolls,
Everybody skip, everybody choose,
Everybody sticks and everybody loose,
Everybodys favours, everybody waits,
Everybodys gorgeous and everybody fakes,
Everybodys screaming, everybodys blind,
Everybody could be dying, anybody fine.

Is this a mirror of myself,
Am I somebody else,
I don't wanna be...everybody!

Everybody..

Everybody run,everybody knows,
Everybody pulls the gun, everybody rolls,
Everybody skips, everybody choose,
Everybody sticks and everybody loose,

Everybodys jealous, everybody objects,
Everybodys anxious, everybody forgets,
Everybodys asking for everybodys aid,
Everybodys bonking unless everybodys paid

Is this a mirror of myself,
Am I somebody else,
I don't wanna be...everybody!
Is this a mirror of myself,
Am I somebody else,
I don't wanna be...everybody!

everybody !
come on!
come on!
come on!
