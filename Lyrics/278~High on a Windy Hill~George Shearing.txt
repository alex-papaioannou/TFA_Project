High on a windy hill
I feel my heart stand still
All I can hear you calling my name
Into a misty blue
I go in search of you 
There in the shadows calling your name
Why are you just beyond me
When will I see your face
Why do you just elude me
And leave me this lonely space
Oh, into eternity your love will beckon me
I can't forget your voice that calls my name 

Into eternity your love will beckon me
I can't forget your voice that calls my name
