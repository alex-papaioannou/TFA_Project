Neath the bougie a thimble rigger slyly rolls the pea
Bye the bye the bye the bye
Red is patchy snows the silver
Bye the bye the bye the bye

Can't turn from a crotch in the darkness
To turn to the valley of a king
Ja-da ja-da ja-da ja-da jing jing jing

Wrapped in blankets then in blankets
Hear the germs pinging on the night wind
Cross the west coast to the west coast to the west coast
The angelus begins

Eye for hand dye why-et eye bye-t 
The negro come on sucker 
Anthrax jesus sack of the-be	 
Shawl for he-be	 
No bye the bye pulling out won't be slow sorry baby be	 
The needles another night I gotta pull muffle 
Bye no bye the bye by the bye no bye the bye

Neath the bougie a thimble rigger slyly rolls the pea
Bye the bye the bye the bye
Red is patchy snows the silver
Bye the bye the bye the bye

Don't think it hasn't been fun because it hasn't
Donje is Donje in the spring
Ja-da ja-da ja-da ja-da jing jing jing

Hear the blankets! Here come the blankets!
They plunge like rays snapping down the night wind
Cross the east coast to the east coast
Scratch the air and blue burn
The angelus begins

Pulling out won't be slow sorry baby staple 
Jesus dreamed he mammoth gathered ye-t bye 
The bye no bye the bye scaling comes scaling comes red is patchy 
Snows the silver an other night gotta pull muffle 
Bye no bye the bye bye the bye no bye the bye
