Afrikaan Beat, We're dancing to the Afrikaan Beat,
I'm burning like the tropical heat
Dancing to the Afrikaan Beat.
 
If you think I hold you too tight, 
Just blame it on the music tonight.
The rhythm soon will make it seem right,
Then your heart and mine will unite.
 
While they play the Afrikaan Beat,
Keep dancing to the AFrikaan Beat,
You're in my arms, the feeling is sweet,
Dancing to the Afrikaan Beat.
 
Let me whisper into your ear
While we are in the right atmosphere,
And no one else would dare interfere,
Why I love to hold you so near.
As they play the Afrikaan Beat.
 
Like a jungle breeze will kiss the trees,
Please let my lips caress your lips as we sway.
Let us dance while the stars all fade away.
Till the break of day here's where we belong,
While the music plays that siren's song.
while we are together, my love,
Let's always stay together my love.
And we can sway forever, my love,
Long as they keep playing my love.
 
Playing with that Afrikaan Beat.
Keep dancing to that Afrikaan Beat
And you will find that life is complete
While we have that Afrikaan Beat.
Always in our hearts, Always in our hearts,
