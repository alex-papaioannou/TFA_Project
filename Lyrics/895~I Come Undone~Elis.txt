Time heals the wounded but my heart still
Bleeds,
I can't get you out of my life
Here is my confession, you're all I need
I don't want to love you but oh oh oh

With the touch of your hand I come undone
With the flash of your burning eyes I know
That you're the only one
I come, I come undone, I come undone

Your footsteps are heartbeats
There's knocking on my door
I swore that I won't let you in
Love's got its heroes but I know that I just
Can't hold out forever and oh, oh oh


With the touch of your hand I come undone
With the flash of your burning eyes I know
That you're the only one
I come, I come undone, I come undone

Don't know what you're doing to me
Cause when your arms reach out I'm gone
Here is my confession, you're all that I need
I don't want to love you but oh, oh oh

With the touch of your hand I come undone
With the flash of your burning eyes I know that
You're the only one
I come, I come undone, I come, I come undone
