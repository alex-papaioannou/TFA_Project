Together we'll stand
Divided we'll fall
Come on now people
Let's get on the ball
And work together
Come on, come on
Let's work together
(Now now people)
Because together we will stand
Every boy, every girl and man
People, when things go wrong
As they sometimes will
And the road you travel
It stays all uphill
Let's work together
Come on, come on
Let's work together
You know together we will stand
Every boy, girl, woman and man
Oh well now, two or three minutes
Two or three hours
What does it matter now
In this life of ours
Let's work together
Come on, come on
Let's work together
(Now now people)
Because together we will stand
Every boy, every woman and man
Come on, let's work together...
Well now, make someone happy
Make someone smile
Let's all work together
And make life worthwhile
Let's work together
Come on, come on
Let's work together
(Now now people)
Because together we will stand
Every boy, girl, woman and man
Oh well now, come on you people
Walk hand in hand
Let's make this world of ours
A good place to stand
And work together
Come on, come on
Let's work together
(Now now people)
Because together we will stand
Every boy, girl, woman and man
Well now together we will stand
Every boy, girl, woman and man
