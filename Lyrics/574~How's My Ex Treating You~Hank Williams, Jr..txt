How's my ex, my ex treating you
Has she had time, time to find someone new
Any day now will be her last,
son, I know from the past
'Cause I was once, once there too,
how's my ex treating you?

Like the sand she moves with the tide
Your two arms will never keep her satisfied
You can't keep her satisfied
She'll use you just the way she used me too
But up till now how's my ex treating you?

Like the sand she moves with the tide
Your two arms will never keep her satisfied
She'll use you just the way you use her too
But up till now how's my ex treating you?
