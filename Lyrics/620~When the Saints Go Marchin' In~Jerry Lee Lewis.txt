[Chorus]
Well when the saints go marchin' in
Well when the saints go marchin in
Oh lord i want to be in that number
When the saints go marchin' in

When the sun refuse to shine
Well when the sun refuse to shine
Oh lord i want to be in that number
When the sun refuse to shine

[Chorus: x2]
