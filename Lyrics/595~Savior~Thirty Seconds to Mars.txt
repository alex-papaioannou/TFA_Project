Until you crash
Until you burn
Until you lie
Until you learn
Until you see
Until you believe
Until you fight
Until you fall
Until the end of everything and all
Until you die
Until you're alive

Don't save me, don't save me, 'cause I don't care
Don't save me, don't save me, 'cause
I don't care

Until you give
Until you've used
Until you've lost
Until you lose
Until you see, how come you believe?
Until you've lived a thousand times
Until you've seen the other side
This is my chance, this is my chance

Don't save me, don't save me, 'cause I don't care
Don't save me, don't save me, 'cause
I don't care

Until the truth becomes a lie
Until you change, until you deny
Until you believe

This is my chance, this is my chance
I'll take it now because I can
This is my chance, I want it now

Don't save me, don't save me, 'cause I don't care
Don't save me, don't save me, 'cause
I don't care

Save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me
I don't care
