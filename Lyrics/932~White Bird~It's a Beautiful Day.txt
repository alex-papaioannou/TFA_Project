White bird
In a golden cage
On a winter's day
In the rain

White bird
In a golden cage
Alone

The leaves blow
Across the long, black road
To the darkened skies
In it's rage

But the white bird
Just sits in her cage
Unknown

White bird must fly
Or she will die

White bird
Dreams of the aspen trees
With their dying leaves
Turning gold

But the white bird
Just sits in her cage
Growing old

White bird must fly
Or she will die
White bird must fly
Or she will die

The sunsets come
The sunsets go
The clouds roll by
And the earth turns old
And the young bird's eyes
Do always glow

She must fly
She must fly
She must fly

White bird
In a golden cage
On a winter's day
In the rain

White bird
In a golden cage
Alone

White bird must fly
Or she will die
White bird must fly
Or she will die
White bird must fly
Or she will die
