Whenever I try to hold my baby
She just stand there for a while
No matter how I try to please that woman
She won`t even crack a smile
Lord, maybe you in heaven can help me
`Cause this is one evil child
Oh, I say maybe, maybe somebody can help me
Because this is one evil child

When I buy her flowers or candy
She just looks at me and growls
She say, "You must be guilty or have a guilty conscience, buddy"
Because I`m convicted without a trial
She just grunts when I call baby, hmm one evil child
I said, "Lord, maybe you can help me, because she`s a strange and evil child"

Still, I`m tryin` to please my woman but she's `bout to drive me wild
I buy her hundred-dollar dresses, people
Still she complains about the style
Won`t somebody give me a suggestion?
Help me with this evil child
Oh, maybe the Lord in heaven above can help me
'Cause, I'll tell you, she's an evil child
