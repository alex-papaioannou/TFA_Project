I was out on my own in a great big world
Thought I'd seen it all
Then along comes a woman, a fantasy
Then I took the fall

I was chasing a dream, I was fancy free
I was so naive
You were all wrapped up in a mystery
You looked good to me

And I needed love, I wanted it desperately
But oh, real love, you never came to me

I was lost in your world of fantasy
I was caught, caught in your game of make-believe
I was lost, lost in your world of fantasy

Lost in your world of fantasy
Look what you've done to me
Lost in your world of fantasy
Look what you've done to me

You were drawin' me in to a spider's web
With your hungry eyes
I was under your power I was in your spell
I was hypnotized

And oh sweet love, you wore such a strange disguise
So neat love, the way I fell for your lies

I was lost in your world of fantasy
I was caught, caught in your game of make-believe
I was lost, lost in your world of fantasy

Lost in your world of fantasy
Look what you've done, done to me

All the times you lied and all the times I cried
I'm never gonna be the same again

Lost in your world of fantasy
Look what you've done to me

Lost in your world of fantasy
Look what you've done to me

Lost in your world of fantasy
Look what you've done to me
Lost in your world of fantasy
Look what you've done to me

Lost in your world of fantasy
Look what you've done to me
