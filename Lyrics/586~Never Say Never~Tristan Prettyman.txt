Wish I would've listened to myself
You would've thought I'd known better
Shouldn't trust my heart this time
But the mind, it changes like the weather
The scars will fade away, and I may never be the same
But you can't start a fire in the pouring rain
Never say never

Now I hear you're back to your old self
And I still can't imagine
Why you take something good, like love, like us
And pretend it never happened
Cause you'll look back one day
And you'll wish we still had that flame
But you can't start a fire in the pouring rain
Never say never

You said you would never let me go
You promised me, our love written on the wall
Felt so easy but I should've known better
To never say never

Gotta be careful what you give
You never know just what you get
Who knows, maybe the best hasn't happened yet
Some days I still feel the same
And my love, it still remains
Wish I could start a fire in the pouring rain

You said you would never let me go
You promised me, our love written on the wall
Felt so easy but I should've known better
To never say never

Told the whole world that you were all mine
You put it in my head that we were doing fine
Am I the only one who remembers?
It doesn't matter now if you change your mind
Cause I won't be around when you finally realize
Nothing really lasts forever

Flames in the sky
And there's smoke in my eyes
You set me free
So don't say you miss me
Just don't say you miss me

You said you would never let me go
You promised me, our love written on the wall
Felt so easy but I should've known better
To never say never

We should start a fire in the pouring rain

I may never understand why you left
I guess I just have to accept this is the way it was meant to be
Kind of like how I never understood how the ocean just stops at the shore
And why it doesn't wash away the land
If only someone could hold my heart and my hand
And make it feel like you did, and not give up so easy
There's no need to be angry, it's okay to be sad
I just have to trust there's something better for me out there 
Swirling around in the universe
Someone who will believe in themselves as much as I do
And never take a wish for granted and always count the stars
Looking back, you're always closer than you thought
There's no point now in starting something new
The heart wants what the heart wants
And none of it matters in the end if you can't love someone back
Love and truth are whispering, "you can't start a fire in the pouring rain"
