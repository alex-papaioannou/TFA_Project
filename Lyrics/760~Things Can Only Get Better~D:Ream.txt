You can walk my path
You can wear my shoes
Learn to talk like me and be an angel too

But maybe you ain't never gonna feel this way
You ain't never gonna know me, but I know you
I'm singing it now

Things can only get better
Can only get better if we see it through
That means me and I mean you too
So teach me now that things can only get better
They can only get, they only get, take it on from here
You know I know that things can only get better

I, sometimes I lose myself in me
I lose track of time
And I can't see the wood for the trees
You set them alight
Burning bridges as you go
I'm too weak to fight you
I've got my personal hell to deal with, then you say

Walk my path
Wear my shoes
Talk like that
I'll be an angel then
Things can only get better
Can only get better, now
I found you

Things can only get better
They can only get better
Now I found you
And you and you

You've shown me prejudice and greed
And you've shown me how I must learn to deal with this disease
I look at things now in a different light than I did before
And I've found the cause
And I think you can be my cure
So teach me to

Walk your path
Wear your shoes
Talk like that
I'll be an angel and things can only get better

Things can only get, can only get
Things can only get, can only get
Things can only get, can only get
Things can only get, can only get
