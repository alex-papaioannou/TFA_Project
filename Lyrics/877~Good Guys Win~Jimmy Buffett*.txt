So you're looking for a hero
That you can see with your own eyes
When they don't wear the mask and cape
They're hard to recognize

Even though these are cynical times
Bear it in mind

Good guys win
Every once in while
Full grown men
Get to learn from a child
Now and then
Just when you think it won't happen again
The good guys win

Trouble all around us
Dirty tricks at every turn
Seems that we historically 
Refuse to live and learn

You start to wonder if all
Hope is gone
You would be wrong

Good guys win
Every once in while
Full grown men
Get to learn from a child.
Now and then
Just when you think it won't happen again
Good guys win.

State of confusion we're so disillusioned
You turn on the news and
Good guys win
Now and then
Just when you think it won't happen again

Good guys win
Every once in while
Full grown men
Get to learn from a child
Now and then
Just when you think it won't happen again
The Good guys win.
