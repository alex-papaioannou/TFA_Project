[Chorus]
Sometimes I hear you calling out my name, 
And I hear you deep down inna mi brain, 
If I'm a fool I've only got myself to blame, 
Well I can see the sign 'cause I'm not blind, 
Although you're not mine from time to time, 
I've got to let you know you are my sunshine, my sunshine. 

I love you baby but you don't love me back, why, 
You drive me crazy 'cause yu fi gi mi dat bly, 
You make me high! I just can't deny, 
Love out potential a fill up inna I and I, 
Just give me the privilege and run a way yu man, 
I got the plan! fi mek yu tun on, 
Baby just believe me 'cause my word is my bond!, 
Sometime I think I hear you but I am hearing wrong, girl. 

[Chorus]

Rude bwoy loving a nu something fi she ramp wid, 
Everyman him need a woman fi be a live blanket, 
If she diss yu, spank it, you hold dat and crank it, 
Baby girl you know I love you but you follow yu friend dem, 
Now you gonna break Sean Paul heart in two, 
You have the dapper all a bawl and all a mek phone call. 
What yu really expect man fi do. 

[Chorus]

Tick, tock mi get heart attack, 
When mi hear she leaving and she naw come back, 
Mi can believe me dreams to mi love world crash, 
A lucky thing she never know where mi hide mi stash, but. 

[Chorus]
