Three o'clock in the morning
You're still here with me
We left a trail of destruction
But now after all
I've put you through

I'm starting to see
A world without you
Means nothing to me

Home, I just want to take you home
I don't want to be alone
And I cant believe you're standing here with me
Time, it took me a little time
How could I have been so blind?
And I cant believe you're standing here with me

I was looking for blue skies
Wrapped up in my own sweet world
But all I found were the dark clouds
But now that you've blown them all away

It's suddenly clear,
I still need you 
To kiss away the tears

Home, I just want to take you home
I don't want to be alone
And I cant believe you're standing here with me
Time, it took me a little time
How could I have been so blind?
And I cant believe you're standing here with me

Here with me
Stay here with me
I need you here with me
I need you here with me

Home, I just want to take you home
I don't want to be alone
And I cant believe you're standing here with me
Time (time) it took me a little time
How could I have been so blind?
And I cant believe you're standing here with me

Three o'clock in the morning
You're still here with me
