The barn fell down
Since i saw it last
It's rubble now
Well so much for the past

Everything that i say
Does me this'a way
Everything,
Every little thing i say
Does me this'a way

Some call her a thief
And some people call her a prophet
But her courage is brief
Brief as little, little miss muffet

Everything that i say
Does me this'a way
Everything,
Every little thing i say
Does me this'a way

She wanted to
Be an inventor
But nothing new 
Was all she could muster
