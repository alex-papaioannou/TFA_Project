See my friends across the red sky why don't they fly 
Simple truth is all I ask for but no reply 

You won't cry for me, I'm twisting around my own head, falling around for me 
Sitting in a tunnel watching other people go home 
A night alone watching other people going home 
I try to see it from the other side she loves me 
But she knows I slide all night
