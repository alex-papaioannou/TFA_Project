Perpetual torture, from those we love to hate.
It's meant to be, you can't change fate.

We got a time bomb ..
.. 5-4-3-2-1 go

The time will come when we gotta say no.
Decide ourselves who's friend or foe.

It's in our hands, above your head.
Think carefully or you'll be dead.

It's happened before, been called a traitor.
'cause we control .. the detonator.
