L laughed it off when she left, l said she'd come back again
Don't we all have the right to be wrong now and then

She won't come home, says her love will never be mine again
Don't we all have the right to be wrong now and then

I forgot that with love there are two ways to fall

She won't come home, says her love will never be mine again
Don't we all have the right to be wrong now and then

I laughed it off when she left, l said she'd come back again
Don't we all have the right to be wrong now and then
