Draw the curtain,
Blind the light
Say nothing
Beautiful night

When we hear them, 
We will call
When we wake up,
We will fall

Grey forever,
Rainy sky
Facing window,
Fragile smile
Quiet evening,
Quiet life
Silent moves in
A beam of light

She builds a statue
Of thin white air
For him to believe in,
Not to fill with fear

He tries all he can 
To find a way
He tries everything
To understand
