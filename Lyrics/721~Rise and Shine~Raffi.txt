Rise with the blue bird
Shine like the sun
Now is time to rise and shine

Rise and shine
The world's been turning
Everyone is waking

Rise and shine
On this new day the morning
Light is breaking

Rise with the rest of us
Shine like a pearl
Rise and show your love
All around the world

Ooh, rise with the blue bird
Shine like the sun
Now is the time to rise and shine

Rise and shine
Today is calling and
This is what it saying

Rise and shine
Your friends are waking
It's time for work and playing

Rise with the rest of us
Shine like a pearl
Rise and show your love
All around the world

Ooh rise with the blue bird
Shine like the sun
Now is the time to rise and shine
Yes, now is the time to rise and shine
