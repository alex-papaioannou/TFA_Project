Open up and let me in
Show the bruises on your skin
Let the fires all burn out
I can hear the silent shout in you
Let it go don't be so scared
Find the love you lost again
Let the chaos disappear
Don't you know I'm always here for you?

'Cause this is devotion, I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion, I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
'Cause this is devotion

Tell me what you dream about
I lose you in my sleep, somehow
Let the chaos disappear
Don't you know I'm always there for you?

'Cause this is devotion, I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion, I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
'Cause this is devotion

'Cause this is devotion, I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion, I am caught
Floating in your gravity

'Cause this is devotion, I am lost
You're the only one I see
Our bodies in motion, I am caught
Floating in your gravity
Whenever you break, I'll fix it for you
I'm the one who drives to you at night
And maybe we'll fall a little deeper
I think our little hearts will be alright
'Cause this is devotion
