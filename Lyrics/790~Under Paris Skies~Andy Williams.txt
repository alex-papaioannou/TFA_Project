Stranger beware, there's love in the air under Paris skies
Try to be smart and don't let your heart catch on fire
Love becomes king the moment it's spring under Paris skies
Lonely hearts meet somewhere on the street of desire

Parisian love can bloom high in a skylight room
Or in a gay caf√© where hundreds of people can see

I wasn't smart and I lost my heart under Paris skies
Don't ever be a heartbroken stranger like me

Oh, I fell in love
Yes, I was a fool
For Paris can be so beautifully cruel
Paris is just a gay coquette who wants to love and then forget
Stranger beware, there's love in the air

Just look and see what happened to me under Paris skies
Watch what you do, the same thing can happen to you

Watch what you do, the same thing can happen to you
Watch what you do, the same thing can happen to you
