Angelina, though your eyes have been closed all your life
Angelina, let my love be their light

Though I'm a painter you can't see my pictures
But you know the colors I use
They flash in your mind still you don't know their meaning
But I'll teach the meaning to you

Angelina, though your eyes have been closed all your life
Angelina, let my love be their light

You never looked at the face that I cherish
Or see the sun in your hair
I will speak softly and touch you and kiss you
To prove I'm there

Angelina, hm
Angelina, let my love be your light

Angelina, just like the night is a part of the day
You're a part of me

Angelina, though your eyes have been closed all your life
Angelina, let my love be your light

Angelina, hm
Can you see me Angelina? Hm
Can you see me Angelina?
