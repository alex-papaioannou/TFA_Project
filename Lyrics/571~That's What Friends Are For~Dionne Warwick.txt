And I  never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned

I'm glad I got the chance to say That I do believe I love you
And if  I should ever go away
Well then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we  do today and then if you can remember
Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowing you can always  count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for

Well you came and opened me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way I thank you
And then for the times when we're  apart
Well  then  close your eyes and know
These words are coming   from  my heart
And then if you can remember

Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowing you can always  count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for
