On our last trip to the coast
We watched the boats sail the sea
"How effortlessly they float"
You turned and said to me

And sedately I sat there
In my quiet mist of rage
How I wanted to tell you
But I was hushed by my shame

So when the waves come rolling in
Then I won't turn the tide
And in the line of fire
You'll set me aside
So go on Richard let go

And I can still remember
The laughter in a stranger's face
And the way you would tell me
To slow down my pace

See no living is that easy
No living is that fair
Of course I was going to lose you
Were you ever even there?

So when the waves come rolling in
Then I won't turn the tide
And in the line of fire
You'll set me aside
So go on Richard let go
