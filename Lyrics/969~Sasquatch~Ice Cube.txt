I think they spotted me

They call me Sasquatch, please check the watch
This is Bigfoot, don't get it shook
Out in Japan they call me Godzilla
Up in Africa, King Kong gorilla

Michael Joe Jackson used to call me Thriller
All my enemies swear I'm Attila
Vietnam vet, burn down your villa
Captain Crunch scream, serial killer
Out in O-Town I'm a fucking pirate
Think I'm Rodney King? We can start a riot
You a fat bitch, I'm a fucking diet
You in solitary, I'm piece and quiet
This a nightmare on Elm Street
You're just a runaway, where the pimps be
You'se a thirsty man, I'm so empty
At your funeral, no sympathy

They call me Sasquatch, please check the watch
This is Bigfoot, don't get it shook
Out in Japan they call me Godzilla
Up in Africa, King Kong gorilla

They call me Sasquatch, please check the watch
Please check the time, I'm like turpentine
And it's burping time, you exhausted I know
Cause I'm overtime and I'm over the line
Come over to mine, I already left
You wanting a rhyme, bitch? I'm So So Def
You ready to shine, I'm already blind, you already lyin'
A nigga ain't buyin' what you selling, always open; 7/11
When I blow niggas know here come tsunami
You got a bucket list, my list is Bugatti
You that drowning kid at the pool party
I'm the carnivore over your body

They call me Sasquatch, please check the watch
This is Bigfoot, don't get it shook
Out in Japan they call me Godzilla
Up in Africa, King Kong gorilla

Don't make me, don't make me put this foot up your ass
(Don't do it)
Don't make me, don't make me put this foot up your ass
(Don't)
Don't make me, don't make me put this foot up your ass
What you do? Bring it down and bring me my cash

You'se a fucking prick, but I'm Moby Dick
I'm Darth Vader, you Obi Wan Kenobi, bitch
He's Jim Kelly, y'all, I'm Terry Bradshaw
He is baby ass, I'm like diaper rash
I'm like stinking trash, I'm like party crash
Like getting caught with hash
I'm like your stolen cash
I like you feeling bad, they call me Schleprock
I like the whole country looking at the debt clock
Pyroclastic flow, this is Pompeii
Whoever in the way, turn you into clay
Call me out my name and that's a hurricane
I'll send the wind and the water and the pouring rain
I am boring, mane, I am snoring, mane
I'm the pain that's wearing off the Novacane
I'm the weight you gained, I make your titties hang
I'm the crowded train that just hit the mane

They call me Sasquatch, please check the watch
This is Bigfoot, don't get it shook
Out in Japan they call me Godzilla
Up in Africa, King Kong gorilla

They call me Sasquatch, please check the watch
This is Bigfoot, don't get it shook
Out in Japan they call me Godzilla
Up in Africa, King Kong gorilla
