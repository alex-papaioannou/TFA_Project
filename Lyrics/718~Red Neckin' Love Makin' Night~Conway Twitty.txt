Hey

Hello baby, Conway here
Let me lay this in your ear
Get ready to go, but we gonna roll about sundown
I got some boogie woogie music on the old 8-track
Yeah, I got the top laid back
And we'll go cruisin' and we'll go foolin' around

Well here I am baby, are you ready to play?
Slide it on in, we'll slip away
We gotta get it, we ain't got a minute to waste
I got a 6-pack of longnecks, the trunk on ice
Ooh but you sure look nice
Makes me want to hug you and kiss you all over your face

Well it's a red neckin', love makin' night
You ain't had much 'til you been touched in the moonlight
You feel it the most when you get real close and you hold on tight
It's a red neckin', love makin' night
It's a red neckin', love makin' night

Stars in your eyes, the wind in your hair
Oh, what a down home love affair
When we go out walkin', we know what we're talkin' about
Listen to the whippoorwills how they sing
Just like us, they're doin' their thing
We know what we got when the nights gets hot down south

Yeah, it's a red neckin', love makin' night
You ain't had much 'til you been touched in the moonlight
You feel it the most when you get real close and you hold on tight
It's a red neckin', love makin' night
It's a red neckin', love makin' night

It's a red neckin', love makin' night
You ain't had much 'til you been touched in the moonlight
You feel it the most when you get real close and you hold on tight
Well, it's a red neckin', love makin' night
It's a red neckin', love makin' night

Hey
Eat your heart out killer
You know I love you

Red neckin', love makin' night
Now don't wreck-in my phone son
Let him in dear
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, hold on tight
Ahh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

A red neckin', love makin' night
You ain't had much 'til you been touched in the moonlight
You feel it the most when you get real close and you hold on tight
It's a red neckin', love makin' night
It's a red neckin', love makin' night
