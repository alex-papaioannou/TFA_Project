Every time I'm near you  my heart jumps all about
My mind can't figure out  what to do
But I've been disillusioned  enough by love turned blue  
Your love could be true  but I wonder
 
Am I  supposed to think  your love will be true
And deny the part of me that says you'll leave me too
Cause yesterday reminds me  that what I've lost is gone
Your love may linger on  but I wonder
 
I heard all your stories they ring well in my ears
But raise certain fears  and doubts 
Cause yesterday reminds me  that what I've lost is gone
Your love may linger on  but I wonder
I wonder   yeah I wonder
