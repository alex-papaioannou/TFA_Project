I'm writing you now from the valley of the silver moon
I get on pretty well here just sit around and play my tunes
But when my words come out its like oil and water
Separation and no reaction

The harden stone in the valley of the silver moon
I said I'm writing you now from the valley of the silver
I'm writing you now from the valley of the silver
The silver moon, the silver moon, the silver

I'm writing you now from the crescent of the moon
So many people all around, people passing by my room
Before it leaves the body, they'll never find
The maker comes down, he'll never even see it

Desire for life the valley of the silver moon
I said I'm writing you now from the valley of the silver moon
I'm riding you now from the valley of the silver
The silver moon, the silver moon, the silver
