I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!
I'm in the mood for love
