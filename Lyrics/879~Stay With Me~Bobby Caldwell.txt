How can you say it's over
What can there be that we can't over come
Why do you turn away
Are you so afraid of needing someone
Didn't we say forever
I still believe feeling's strong enough
Before you walk away
Let me here
You say you don't need my love

[Chorus :]
Stay with me
Darling after all that we've been through
Nobody else can warm your lonely nights
No one's gonna love you like I do
Stay with me
Can't you see we've got too much to lose
Oh stay with me, stay with me baby please
Where is our happy ending
And all of our promises
Did you forget
Tell me what's the use in love if it can less
No I can't never let you live in this way
I want you to stay

[Chorus]

Got to make you stay somehow
Tell me what is gonna take it
I can't live without you
So please don't leave me now
