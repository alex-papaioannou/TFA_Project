No regrets altho' our love affair has gone astray
No regrets I know I'll always care though you're away
Somehow our happy romance ended suddenly
Still in my heart you'll be forever mine
 
No regrets because somebody new looks good to you
No regrets sweetheart no matter what you say or do
I know our love will linger when the other love forgets 
Still in my heart you'll be forever mine
