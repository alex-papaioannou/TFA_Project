Sunshine that is what I try to follow
Long time, searching for a new tomorrow
I'm always in and out of love

Dawning,  love is always round the corner
Working, trying to fill a special order
Still falling in and out of love

Now I know just how I want to be
I know what makes me happy
Looking for my soul
Started getting old
Found my way, found my heart
Now my life can really start

Journey, Looking for someone to please me
Now I see,
Pleasin's got to start here with me
Still I fall in and out of love

Now I know just how I want to be

Now I see,
Pleasin's got to start with me
Still I fall in and out of love

Making it so Tight
Trying it out now
Making if feel alright.
