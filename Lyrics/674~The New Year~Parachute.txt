I'm sick of cleaning up the mess you left behind
Oh what a way to start the new year
On my hands and knees and cleaning out the dirt and grime
Oh what a way to start the new year
I'm sick of holding both ends of a tightrope
Cause when you fall all that's left is old high hopes for me
I'm stretched thin to the end tryna keep it all in
Oh what a way to start the new year

Won't you say that it's all right?
Won't you tell me it's okay?
Because there is three hundred and sixty four more days
I might be smiling but you'll never even hear me say
That I like it in the shadows
Counting down to zero, just to start again
Oh what a way to start the new year

Don't get me wrong I hate this holiday
(Oh what a way to start the new year)
On my hands and knees and choosing what I have to say
(Oh what a way to start the new year)
I never realized it could mean so much
Just to go to bed later when we have to get up, all the same
And we scream and clap
For the end of what was, and what we become oh

Won't you say that it's all right
Won't you tell me it's okay
Cause we have three hundred and sixty four more days
I might be smiling but you'll never even here me say
That I like it in the shadows
Counting down to zero, just to start again
Oh what a way to start the new year

But was it really that bad
And could it be better
Well I don't know, but with you I still have hope
That this, could be, all my year

(We have) Three hundred and sixty four more days
One million chances left to find you and to see your face
Making light out of my shadows
Finally get to zero and maybe we'll both say (x2)

Oh what a way to start the new year
