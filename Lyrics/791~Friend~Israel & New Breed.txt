(Chorus)
Friend there will never be a friend
As dear to me as You
There will never be another
Closer than a brother
Friend always worth the wait
Faithful as the day
You say we are friends

You know all about me
The good and the bad
You know when I rise and fall

You see my beginning
You stand at the end
And yet You remain
Faithful to say I'm Your friend

(Repeat Chorus)

Everytime You call me
I receive Your healing
Everytime You call me friend

(Repeat Chorus)
