Well she's a bloodhound chasing me down like I'm a criminal
Runnin and runnin and runnin, like I'm an animal
Billboards promise rewards for my capture
Runnin and runnin and runnin, but she's faster

Mama, say a prayer for me
Mama, say a prayer for
Your only child, out in the wild
Cause she's got him down on his knees
Mama. say a prayer for me

Well I'm addicted to the fix of her chemical
I need it I need it I need, I need a miracle
Water to wine, got me drinkin like a sailor
I need it I need it I need, I need a chaser

Mama, say a prayer for me
Mama, say a prayer for
Your only child, out in the wild
Cause she's got him down on his knees
Mama. say a prayer

She's heartless, heartless, bones and cartilage
Tried to stop it, digging out a splinter
Mother mother, I still want her

Mama, say a prayer for me
Mama, say a prayer for
Your only child, out in the wild
She's got him down on his knees
Your prodigal son's at the point of her gun
And she's got him begging her please
Mama, say a prayer for me
Mama, say a prayer for me
Say a prayer for me, say a prayer for me
