Pour your words out
Come on, I’m not coming back!
Draw the curtains. Come on, that old son is back
My hometown has cursed me, lately
I’m not coming back!

'Cause the last thing that I noticed as that old dream came around
Was a city burning golden as the sun came shining down
And I said they’re still in my mind
And screamed “Goodbye, farewell!” to my hometown.
I’m not coming back.

Fire engines, come on! There’s a race to run.
So, it had been. Come on, there’s the starting gun
My hometown has cursed me, lately
I’m not coming back!

'Cause the last thing that I noticed as that old dream came around
Was a city burning golden as the sun came shining down
And I said they’re still in my mind
I screamed “Goodbye, farewell!” to my hometown.
I’m not coming back.

I’m waking fright, with the moon outside
Sleep won’t come. You don’t really need it
You just can’t tell. You never can, son!
I hope I’ll breath. Hope so too.

I’m waking fright, with the moon outside
Sleep won’t come. You don’t really need it

I hope I’ll breath. Hope so too.
I hope I’ll breath. I-I I’m not coming back.

'Cause the last thing that I noticed as that old dream came around
Was a city burning golden as the sun came shining down
And I said they’re still in my mind
And screamed “Goodbye, farewell!” to my hometown.
I’m not coming back.

I’m not coming back.
I’m not coming back.
