Now I comes from Pomona
The city of G's in California
Where the sun rises the east
And sets the west (Tell the truth player)
Now I ain't tryin to be a hard ass brother
Cause I got game from my sister and my mother (Nah)
They told me the same thing that'll make you laugh
Will make you cry
And they was right on the money
Now I
Bang bang to the rhythm of Quik
Now put the dip in your hip 
And let your backbone slip
It took a real long time for me to get this break
And I'll be damned if I leave it for a sucka to take
Hey Suga Free, I got some whoop whoop
I'm finna get some whop whop
You know I sold my drop top
On Daytons with them knock-offs
Partner you can straight shake the spot
I see the envy and jealousy in your face
And bump what you got fool
Forgot to write me in the penn
Now I'm on parole in the wind
And your trying to fit in
y'all humpback J
E to the A
The L-O-you-S suckas make my day
Sucka
But I'm a cotton-pickin fool
I shoulda listened to Tony Lane
When he told me to shake a sucka like you
Shake-a-shake-a-shake
One sucka a day
Cause misery loves company (OK)
And a, Mr. Sucka For a Trick
a.k.a
Broke jealous trick 
With a itch
To never see me spittin
Here come that sucka with that smile
Talkin about
How my shit flow so dope
He played my tape and got cottonmouth
So I'm knowin bout your fake smile
Pat me on my back
With that he say-she say crap
Because I know something you don't
Like havin thousands
And a ???

Would you like to know a secret?

Would you like to know a secret?

Now I gets my checks in chunks
Blocks and stacks
Looking out for my homies
And family like a mack
So you can do or say whatever floats your boat
But I'ma tell you just like this
I'm far from broke
So while you talk about me 
You need to look at yourself
Who gave Peaches five hundred for ???
I had a life-long dream
To do just this
In and out of jail
And didn't nobody send me shhh
But I ain't mad witcha
I guess we do what we do
And God Bless Chris, Flower, Dante and little Clue
We gotta make it right
Cause Mr. Gilmore is laughing at us
Killing each other
Over nothing every night
So wake up and recognize
What you fail to see
Cause I'm a black man partner
It was hard for me
Trying to get a job
With a cross tattoo under my left eye
They never called me back in interviews
It was hi and bye

And my homegirl Qiana
Bless her soul
Bought me some shoes
I took off them ???
Cause my sacks was through
And moms kicked me out the house
Cause I wasn't paying rent
I got mad for a minute
Now I gots good sense
And me and pops used to go at it
Like every other day
But I apologize 
For all the remarks I used to say
Cause ah
I gots my life where I want it
I met Stan Sheppard, Black Tone, DJ Quik
Now I'm jumping on it
And Black Tone used to buy me clothes
Pay for lawyers and court
So Black Tone's my folks
Unlike some other fools I know
We got a snitch walking round
But I ain't mad at cha
Just don't let me see you
I'ma clown
Cause you smiling in my face
And pat me all on my back
And hate my guts
But steady in the presence of a mack
And if it wasn't for Tony Lane, DJ Quik and Hi-see
Wouldn't none of y'all suckas give a damn about me
Fo sho

I want to say wassup to Black Tone, Hi-see, D, Qia, Thad, Noay
Fly, my partner Bubbah
That's right
My sister Lee
And we out (Hey baby)
(Did you leave out something?)
Nope
