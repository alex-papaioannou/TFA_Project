Hey, ugh
Things and stuff and stuff and things and stuff
Grease me

BSS
Bold soul sister
Oh
Sock it to the biscuits
Bring on down to the bone
Cleaner than big boys with hairy backs
Hey, hey ugh
Bold soul sister

Its my thing, I'm goin' do what I wanna do, hey
Do what you wanna 
When you wanna
How you wanna now do your thing soul sister
Alright

When you wanna
How you wanna now do your thing soul sister

Its hanging, now let it dry
The more I grease you, the smaller you get
Hey, hey, ugh
Bold soul sister

Things and stuff and stuff and things and things
Ugh alright
Do what you wanna 
When you wanna
How you wanna now do your thing soul sister

Alright now

Alright now yeah
