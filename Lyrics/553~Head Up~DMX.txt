[Chorus]
Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky

When I think I don’t deserve it, I think about Jesus
And the fact that he was perfect and he thinks that I’m worth it
I know I got a purpose
So when I don’t like what I see in the mirror
I learn to look passed the surface
Believe me God heard this,
'Cause these words came from my heart
I was in pain, it was dark
Then came the spark to light down the road
To let me know that he would lighten up my load
And it’s gon’ get greater, later
God only wants the best for me
But the devil’s a hater
I can see his eyes through the smiles of fake friends
If yall think hate wins just keep waitin'
At the end of the day who’s will will you think will prevail
Or will you live to tell
Miracle after miracle it comes true
The spiritual individual within you

[Chorus]
Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky

Lord if you hear me,
You know that I’m coming to you sincerely
I need you near me, please feel me
I’m sick and I need for you to heal me
I’m lost and looking for the real me
I’m tired and weary
Haven’t been able to see things clearly
And even though I know you love me dearly
I still get leery
So where does that leave me?
Lost and alone
I wanna call God but it’s like I lost my phone
Every day is a struggle cause I juggle my problems
Need to let go and let God
'Cause only he could solve them
I’m tired of lying to myself
Thinking I could do it on my own
When I get left alone
When the devil sneaks in and creeps in
Knocks on the door lightly than peeks in
And it’s usually around the weekend
Then I get reckless and jump off the deep end
Come on

[Chorus: x4]
Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky

You didn't bring me this far to let me go

[Chorus: x2]
Keep your head to the sky
Keep your head to the sky
