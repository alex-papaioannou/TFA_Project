Play our love's theme tonight
My love's here, it's no dream tonight
It's been so long
Since we've danced to our love song
I know the melody that made him mine
Will be the melody that keeps him close to me (love's theme)

Play our love's theme once more
Make him feel, like he felt before
While the lights are low
Please, let the music flow
I know that the melody that made him mine
Will be the melody that keeps him close to me (love's theme)

Play our love's theme again
Touch his heart, touch his soul and then
Once we sip the wine
His lips will come to mine
I know that the melody that made him mine
Will be the melody that keeps him close to me
Love's theme...
