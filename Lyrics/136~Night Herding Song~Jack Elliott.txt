Oh say, little dogies, why don't you lay down?
You've wandered and trampled all over the ground. 
Lay down, little dogies, lay down.

I have cross-herded, trail-herded, circle-herded too 
But to keep you together â€” that's what I can't do. 
My horse is leg-weary, and I'm awful tired 
But, if I let you get away, I'm sure to get fired. 
Bunch up, little dogies, bunch up.
