Go ahead with what you're doing, you don't have to pay me any mind
don't think I won't get to it, I got plans for her tonight
You can watch her dance forever, you won't hold her in your arms tonight
When it?s all said and done, I will be the one to hold her tight

So let her shine, shine, shine
Sit back and let that little girl shine, shine, shine
When the night is over she?ll be mine, mine, mine
Sit back and let that little girl shine

she's like a brand new penny, even though she never had a dime
See her sparkle see her glisten, no one holds a candle when she shines
She turns a mile a minute, see her twirl just like spinning top
But one thing that you'll find, it?s me who's on her mind when the music stops

So let her shine, shine, shine
Sit back and let that little girl shine, shine, shine
When the night is over she?ll be mine, mine, mine
Sit back and let that little girl shine

You can watch her dance forever, you won't hold her in your arms tonight
When it?s all said and done, I will be the one to hold her tight

So let her shine, shine, shine
Sit back and let that little girl shine, shine, shine
When the night is over she?ll be mine, mine, mine
Sit back and let that little girl shine

Let her shine
Sit back and let that little girl shine, shine, shine
Sit back and let that little girl shine, shine, shine
When the night is over she?ll be mine, mine, mine
Sit back and let that little girl shine
