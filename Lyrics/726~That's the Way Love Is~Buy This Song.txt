As the bitter tears fall from your eyes 
a thousand times you ask yourself why 
the one guy you love has departed 
and you're left alone and broken hearted.
Love just comes and it goes.
How long it's gonna last, say, nobody knows.
 
That's The Way Love Is, baby, 
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
That's The Way Love Is, sugar,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
 
I know you're walkin' down a lonesome road 
and your heart is carryin' a heavy load.
I know you feel like you ain't got a friend 
and your whole world is cavin' in.
Now's the time to be strong, 
you gotta forget him now that he's gone, 
and remember.
 
That's The Way Love Is, baby, 
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
That's The Way Love Is, sugar,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
 
The road of love gets rough some times don't let it get the best of you.
Said I've been hurt by love so many times,
so I know just what you're goin' through.
You wish that you were never born, you gotta forget him now that he's gone, 
just Remember.
 
That's The Way Love Is, baby, 
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
That's The Way Love Is, sugar,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
 
Love is here today and gone tomorrow,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
All of your joys turn to sorrow,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
One day gladness next day sadness,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
 
Love is here today and gone tomorrow,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
All of your joys turn to sorrow,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
One day gladness next day sadness,
(That's The Way Love Is, sure enough how it is.)
