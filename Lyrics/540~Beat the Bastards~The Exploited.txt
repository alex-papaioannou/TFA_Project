Who the fuck are you?

Slaves to the system there's no way out
Slaves to the system do you have a shout
You've got to beat the bastards and beat 'em now
Sick of policies putting me down

Beat the bastards, beat them now
Beat the bastards, beat them now
Beat the bastards, beat them now

Just out of school don't have a clue
No income support for you
Can't get a job don't get a chance
Sick of politics leaving you out

Beat the bastards, beat them now
Beat the bastards, beat them now
Beat the bastards, beat them now

Money, money power and strength
Teenage kids with not to spend
Hungry homeless who gives a shit
Sick of policies leaving me out

Beat the bastards, beat them now
Beat the bastards, beat them now
Beat the bastards, beat them now

You've got to beat the bastards, beat the bastards,
Beat the bastards, you've got to beat the bastards, 
Beat the bastards, you've got to beat the bastards, 
You've got to beat the bastards, 
You've got to beat the bastards, beat the bastards

Slaves to the system there's no way out
Slaves to the system do you have a shout
You've got to beat the bastards and beat 'em now
Sick of policies leaving you out

Beat the bastards, beat them now
Beat the bastards, beat them now
Beat the bastards, beat them now
