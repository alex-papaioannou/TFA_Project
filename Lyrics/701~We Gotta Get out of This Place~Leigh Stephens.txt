In this dirty old part of the city
 Where the sun refused to shine
 People tell me there ain't no use in tryin'

 Now my girl you're so young and pretty
 And one thing I know is true
 You'll be dead before your time is due, I know

 Watch my daddy in bed a-dyin'
 Watched his hair been turnin' grey
 He's been workin' and slavin' his life away
 Oh yes I know it

 (Yeah!) He's been workin' so hard
 (Yeah!) I've been workin' too, baby
 (Yeah!) Every night and day
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!)

 We gotta get out of this place
 If it's the last thing we ever do
 We gotta get out of this place
 'cause girl, there's a better life for me and you
