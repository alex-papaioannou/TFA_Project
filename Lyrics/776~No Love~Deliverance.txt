Though you speak with tongues of angels
Was said so long ago
If love is not the motive
Your evil as our foe

I don't care if you prophesy
Or have the power to heal
If His love does not abide in you
What you do is not real

All you do is make the noise
You use the gifts just like toys
All you are is a sounding bell
With no love

You might be fooling everyone else
But you're not fooling me
You might even think you're fooling God
But believe me He sees

Don't be a fool
God is not mocked
For whatever you sow you'll reap

Let God change your heart
Don't conform to other's ways
Or let your heart remain where it is
In a garbage heap
