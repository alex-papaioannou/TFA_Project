A gypsy told me to let them women be
She said, "A man's your best friend"
I said, "Are you tellin' me?"

'Cause I done got wise now
Oh, to the way these women do
Yeah, you've been tryin' to trick me, baby
Now the trick's done turned on you

I don't know whether my woman was jokin'
Or what she intends to do
But I done pulled the right card
And I done got tattooed

Now, I done got wise
Oh, to the way these women do
Yeah, you've been tryin' to trick me, baby
Now the trick done turned on you

If there's forty-eight cards in the deck
Just give me ten
If you can play with the women
I can play with the men

'Cause I done got wise, baby
Oh, to the way you women do
Yeah, you've been tryin' to trick me, baby
Now the trick's done turned on you

I been married three times
I was drunk as I could be
I had one wife and other
Two women had me

Now, I done got wise
Oh, to the way these women do
Yeah, you've been tryin' to trick me, baby
Now the trick done turned on you

When I used to come from work
You had four or five cousins around
Now I done got me some cousins
Since I come to town

And I done got wise
Oh, to the way you women do
Yeah, you've been tryin' to trick me, baby
Now the trick's done turned on you
