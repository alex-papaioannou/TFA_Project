How sweet it is to be loved by you 

                  I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were 
                  I needed someone to understand my ups and downs and there you were 
                  With sweet love and devotion 
                  Deeply touching my emotion 
                  I want to stop and thank you baby 
                  I just want to stop and thank you baby

                  I close my eyes at night
                  Wondering where would I be without you in my life 
                  Everything I did was just a bore
                  Everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before 
                  But you brighten up for me all of my days 
                  With a love so sweet in so many ways 
                  I want to stop and thank you baby 
                  I just want to stop and thank you baby

                  You were better for me than I was for myself 
                  For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else 
                  I want to stop and thank you baby 
                  I just want to stop and thank you baby
