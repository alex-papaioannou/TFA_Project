John was a scientist, he was hooked on LSD
Interested in mind control and how the monkey held the key
Said that all life is experiments somebody's planning for the heir
It's for the unexpected citizens who hallucinate in fear.
Sing that.

Chew the backbone, 
A solar system, these clever convicts

In union station, with a package in his hand
Tied to the suspect, he chanced him where he stand
And I don't think you realize he's coming for your neck
And the sound is breaking all around
He's keeping lives in check

Chew the backbone, a solar system, these clever convicts

Making his getaway threw a punched out mirror
He blend into the crowd, hear the system scream
And all those spies that strikes your head
Are clinging to their guns
And if you smell those omens man, I think you better run.

Checkout.
