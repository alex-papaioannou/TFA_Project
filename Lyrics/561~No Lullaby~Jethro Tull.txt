Keep your eyes open 
And prick up your ears 
Rehearse your loudest cry.
There's folk out there 
Who would do you harm
So I'll sing you no lullaby.
There's a lock on the window; 
There's a chain on the door:
A big dog in the hall.
But there's dragons and beasties
Out there in the night
To snatch you if you fall.

So come out fighting 
With your rattle in hand.
Thrust and parry. Light
A match to catch the devil's eye.
Bring a cross of fire to the fight.

And let no sleep bring false relief
From the tension of the fray.
Come wake the dead with the scream of life.
Do battle with ghosts at play.

Gather your toys at the call-to-arms
And swing your big bear down.
Upon our necks when we come to set
You sleeping safe and sound.

It's as well we tell no lie
To chase the face that cries.
And little birds can't fly
So keep an open eye.
It's as well we tell no lie
So I'll sing you no lullaby.
