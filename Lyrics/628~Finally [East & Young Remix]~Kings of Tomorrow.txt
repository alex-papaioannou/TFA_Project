Time marches on never ending, 
Time keeps its own time,
Here we stand at beginning, 
And then goes passing us by,
And I, I, I can dream for us all, 
I hope I'm in a better state,
When here and now crumbles and falls 
And you, you , you who make worlds collide
I knew you'd come knocking one day,
Unannounced like a thief in the night.

Where do we go from here, 
Time ain't nothing but time, 
I now have no fear of my fears
And no more tears to cry, 
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow means nothing at all
If we don't hear the line,
When today places its call, and morning, morning, morning
Won't ever be the same, 
Now I won't make the same mistakes, time and time again
Now I won't make the same mistakes, time and time again 
Now I won't make the same mistakes, time and time again 
Now I won't make the same mistakes, time and time again 
Now I won't make the same mistakes, time and time again 

So tell me how do you do
Finally I meet you
You don't know what I've been through,
Waiting and wondering about you
I had a dream my trip would end at you, 
And now I know paradise.
