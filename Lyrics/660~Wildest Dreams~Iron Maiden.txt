I'm gonna organise some changes in my life, 
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past,
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road, 
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go

And I just feel like I can be anything, 
that I might ever wish to be,  
and fantasize just what I want to to be, 
make my wildest dreams come true

I'm on my way. 
Out on my own again I'm on my way out on the road again,

When I remember back to how that things used to be, 
and I was stuck inside a shroud of misery I felt I disappeared so deep inside my self 
I couldn't find a way to break away the hell

When I'm feeling down and low, 
I vow I'll never be the same again, 
I just remember what I am, and visualize what I'm gonna be,

I'm on my way. Out on my own again, 
I'm on my way, I'm gonna break away,

I'm gonna break away, I'm out on my own, 
I'm out on my own, gonna break away, breaking away,

I'm on my way, out my own again, 
I'm on my way, out on the road again, I'm on my way, out on my own again, 
I'm on my way, I'm gonna break away,
