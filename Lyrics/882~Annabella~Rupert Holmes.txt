I just want to wake your heart
but you go to sleep
and you break my heart
Annabella...
where will you be,
who do you see,
when you dream at night?

Could it be the other guy
who had more than me
and was less than shy?
Annabella...
You tease me all day
Please, may I say
that we're on tonight

In the morning
things are working out fine
Come the evening
you refuse to be mine
but you stay
and you say

That I hope to find some love
But each girl I find
will remind me of
Annabella...

In the morning
you say "Wait til tonight"
Come the evening
you say "Now just ain't right"
No surprise...
But I'm wise

I won't take another day
or another night
or another way
Annabella...

Annabella...
Annabella...
Annabella...
Annabella...
Annabella...
Annabella...
