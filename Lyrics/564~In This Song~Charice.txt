I may not know
Where I'm going now
This broken road
Is trying to tear me down
But deep inside I found
A sacred place
That I never knew
Where I feel safe when the road is untrue
Here's what I learned to do

Just sing this song
And it takes me right back
Where I belong
And every day there's a new bridge to cross
But I'm never far from home
If I bring my heart, my soul, my own
In this song

No,
I don't depend on friends
Cause they come and go
My belief in myself
Is gonna carry me through
That's why I'm learning to sing

Oh,
I'm learning now
I'm ready to sing

Just sing this song
And it takes me right back
Where I belong
And every day there's a new bridge to cross
But I'm never far from home
If I put my heart, my soul, my own

I may not have
All the words
That I need to say and
Though I won't always be strong
But I'm never afraid
Cause I hold my destiny, it depends on me
Alone, alone

So, just sing this song
And it takes me right back
Where I belong
And every day there's a new bridge to cross
But I'm never far from home
If I give it my heart, my soul, my own
I keep giving my heart, my soul, my own
In this song
In this song
In this song
