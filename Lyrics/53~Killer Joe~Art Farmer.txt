We like you to meet a friend of ours who goes by the name killer joe. Picture a so called hippie or hip-cat, standing on a corner in a neatly pressed double breasted, form-fitting pinstripped suit. Pair of pointed toed shoes, with bowed white stitches around the soles. A black shirt, a long white tie. Black pencil mustache, and of course a very wide bim black felt hat. Killer Joe always has a pocket full of loot, but only the kind that jingels, see he likes to play the horses. He is most certainly a ladies man As a matter of fact he is always willing to accept cash contributions from them, for any cause, namely his own. The most important thing that you have to know about Killer Joe that you have to know is that he is very much against manual labor.
