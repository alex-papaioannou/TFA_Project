I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I'll give you my heart

I love you, and you alone were meant for me
Please, give your loving heart to me
And say we'll never part

I think of you every morning
Dream of you every night
Darling, I'm never lonely
Whenever you are in sight

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart

I love you for sentimental reasons
I hope you do believe me
I've given you my heart
