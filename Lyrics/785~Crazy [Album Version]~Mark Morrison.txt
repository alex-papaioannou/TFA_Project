All of these girls trippin' on me (trippin')
See here now I'm goin' crazy ever since
I went Number One (like a bomb)
My whole world pandemonium

Everybody crazy turnin' on me
Can't dis a brother for going silly
Everybody crazy trippin' on me
Ain't nothin' wrong standing strong

Walking my 'hood day and night (day and night)
People saying Mark ain't right no (you're crazy)
Doing wrong souped on my song (step off)
Ain't nothing changed leave me alone

Everybody crazy frontin' on me (step off)
Why dis a brother (jungle) for keeping street
Everybody crazy (you're crazy) trippin' on me (you're crazy)
Tell me what's wrong movin' on

Well true we are badder than that
We rougher than that
We tougher than that
We are the wickedest wickedest yout's on the counteract
That nuff a' them wants to see us rise then go see us drop
We're not gonna stop rise until we done hit the top
So don't dispute the wrong just dispute the facts
That if we're coming back we're coming back well phat
So don't believe the hype just go and back your chat
Because round the corner you will find the golden jackpot

Gonna live my life doing my thing (my thing)
Despite the trippin' strong I said yeah
Ain't up on type doggin' my swing (fe real)
My prerogative can never change

Everybody crazy turnin' on me
Can't dis a brother for going silly
Everybody crazy (you're crazy) trippin' on me (you're crazy)
Tell me what's wrong moving on

(Crazy) true they are turning crazy crazy
Yes definitely crazy
Like to say they want to change our personalities
No crazy crazy like mentally crazy
But hip-hop ragamuffin DJ
Is not going to let them get to we (crazy)
Because nuff a' them try hard just to blank we
But they can't get us out of their memory
Those who can't believe it or even see we
Might as well hear we out in reality

Everybody crazy all of these girls (everybody)
Trippin' on me (everybody) see me now (everybody)
I'm going crazy (I don't wanna talk to you no more)
