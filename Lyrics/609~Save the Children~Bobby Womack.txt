Save the children and we might save the world
It's every mother's wish for her boy and girl, oh

A child was born inside this city yesterday
His mother held him to her breast as she began to pray
Please let them grow up to be strong and know the truth

And have the chances to taste the innocence of youth
The innocence of youth, the innocence of youth
You know what we have to do

Save the children and we might save the world
It's every mother's wish for her boy and girl, oh

A baby starts out with his back against the wall
He has to learn to survive before he learns to crawl
He needs somebody who can give him a daddy hand

We brought them into this world, they deserve a chance
They deserve a chance, got to have a chance
Why can't we all understand?

Save the baby, save him, ohh ohh, save him

The world is lost in a bout of confusion
Happiness, happiness, happiness is just an illusion
Somewhere it must end even if we have to start
Stop and start again, we're defendin' a man's sin

Oh, what's going on, what's going on?
I can remember another friend of mine tellin' me
Change gonna come, oh, yes it will

Save the children and we might save the world
Every mother's wish for her boy and girl, oh

Save, save the children, save, save the children
Save, save the children, we gotta save the children

Save, save the children, save, save the children
Save, save the children, we gotta save the children

Listen, headed in the wrong direction
No love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love and affection
Like a [Incomprehensible] pain we tryin' to figure it out

No young boys playin' in the park and havin' fun
They find their manhood at the barrel of a loaded gun
Can't see their future, just a tunnel with no light

I'm lost in the projects runnin' from the night
Runnin' from the night, runnin' from the night
Runnin' from the night, runnin' from the night
Scared for the rest of their life

Save, save the children, save, save the children
Save, save the children, save, save the children

We gotta save the children, save, save the children
Save, save the children

Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
We've got to stop
